## JIMMA UNIVERSITY
 Electrical and Computer Engineering 5th Year Assignment
 
checkers-playing robot that employs computer vision algorithms that has a vision using YOLOv5 deep learning model, and an RRR manipulator. The goal is to use this system to enable the robot to accurately recognize and move pieces on the checkers board.

### Features

- Play with AI powered checker game using RRR Manipulator;
- Full-featured: Real-time Camera Preview, Image Manipulation, Display Stack image, Interactive GUI using pygame

####Run Code

`$ python Checkerboard.py`

# Hardware Part
Hardware part had been designed first using blender and calculate forward kinematics of the robot
doing such 3D stuff used for analysed jacobian workplace of the given manipulator and how things will order themselves

# 3D Simulation of Forward Kinematics

-Since this project is currently in the demo stage, certain bugs still need to be fixed.
I'm delighted to have anyone improve this project!
